# Guardian

A privacy-preserving elderly-care room monitor. Presence, respiration, and fall
alerts from ESP32-S3 CSI nodes. No camera, no pose estimation, no raw CSI
leaving the node.

```bash
cd guardian
cargo run --bin guardian -- --udp-bind 0.0.0.0 --udp-allow 192.168.1.0/24 --alert-nodes 1
```

Two binaries: `guardian`, the monitor, and `guardian-replay`, which feeds it a
recorded capture.

## Why this is a separate crate

Guardian is deliberately **not** a member of the `v2/` workspace. That workspace
pulls in nine git submodules and ~60 crates of pose machinery, none of which
this binary uses; at the time Guardian was written none of those submodules were
initialised, so `cargo check` could not even load the workspace manifest.

The keep-list for this product is three things:

| Keep | Why |
|---|---|
| `firmware/esp32-csi-node/` | the working sensor, untouched |
| the UDP vitals receive path | ~200 lines that parse the 32-byte packet |
| a thin alert layer | "no breathing 60 s", "fall flag", "no presence 12 h" |

Guardian is the second and third of those. It talks to the first over UDP and
depends on nothing else in the repository.

## The design constraint: trust the firmware

`firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/edge_processing.c` is correct in approach:

- it measures the **true** inter-frame sample rate from timestamps
  (EMA-smoothed, clamped 8-30 Hz) rather than assuming one;
- it designs real **temporal** biquad bandpass filters at 0.1-0.5 Hz (breathing)
  and 0.8-2.0 Hz (heart), re-tuning on >15% rate drift;
- it extracts and unwraps per-subcarrier phase.

It emits all of that as `edge_vitals_pkt_t` (`edge_processing.h:140`, 32 bytes).
**Guardian's job is to trust that packet, not to re-derive it.** There is no
signal processing in this crate, and adding any should be treated as a
regression.

### What re-deriving it cost last time

The previous server recomputed these features itself and got all of them wrong.
Measured 2026-08-26 with `evidence/motion-test.py` (3-phase A/B/C test, 30 s
each: still / moving / still, ~2030 frames per phase; raw output in
`evidence/motion-test-results.json`):

| Signal | Still A | Moving B | Still C | B : still |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `motion_band_power` | 98.9 | 94.5 | 88.2 | 1.01 (blind) |
| `breathing_band_power` | 115.0 | 109.2 | 110.1 | 0.97 (blind) |
| `spectral_power` | 268.5 | 265.4 | 263.4 | 1.00 (blind) |
| raw CSI temporal variance, node 1 | 0.60 | 2.17 | 0.41 | 4.3x (works) |
| raw CSI temporal variance, node 2 | 0.27 | 1.22 | 0.28 | 4.4x (works) |
| raw CSI temporal variance, node 3 | 3.87 | 6.12 | 1.84 | 2.1x (unstable) |

Every named server feature was blind to a person walking and waving. The four
root causes, all in `v2/crates/wifi-densepose-sensing-server/src/main.rs`:

1. **Band powers used the wrong axis** (L2453-2473). `motion_band_power` and
   `breathing_band_power` split the *subcarrier array* in half and labelled the
   halves "motion" and "breathing" — that is spatial frequency across the
   channel, dominated by static multipath from walls and furniture. Breathing is
   0.1-0.5 Hz *in time*. These features could not detect what they were named
   after at any SNR.
2. **The working signal was masked** (L2447). `compute_subcarrier_variances()`
   computes correct temporal variance — the 4x signal above — and then
   `intra_variance.max(temporal_variance)` discarded it every frame, because
   intra is ~100 and temporal is ~0.5-6.
3. **Sample rate wrong by ~7x** (L6782). The server hardcoded `1000.0 / 500.0`
   = 2 Hz while the firmware measured 13-19 Hz. At an assumed 2 Hz, Nyquist is
   1 Hz, so heart rate (1.0-1.7 Hz) was above the sampling limit: the server was
   arithmetically incapable of producing a real heartbeat.
4. **Window too short** (`FRAME_HISTORY_CAPACITY = 100`, L1597). 100 frames at
   ~15 Hz is 6.7 s; resolving 0.1 Hz breathing needs one full 10 s cycle
   minimum, realistically 30-60 s.

Guardian does not fix these. It stops asking the question.

## Alert rules

All thresholds are flags; the defaults are shown.

| Alert | Condition | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `fall` | a trusted node raised the firmware fall flag | immediate |
| `no_breathing` | someone is present but no breathing rate in the 6-30 BPM band has arrived | 60 s |
| `no_presence` | no trusted node has seen anyone | 12 h |
| `node_silent` | a trusted node stopped reporting (equipment health, not a care alert) | 60 s |

Several rules exist specifically to avoid false alarms, which in a care product
are not a cosmetic problem — they are how the product gets unplugged:

- **Leaving the room is not apnea.** With nobody present, the breathing question
  is not asked at all. The clock also reseeds when presence begins, so walking
  back in cannot instantly trip the alarm before the firmware's filter locks.
- **Equipment failure is not apnea.** If no fresh trusted node still sees the
  person, `no_breathing` is suspended and `node_silent` fires instead. The
  honest signal is "the monitor is broken", never "she stopped breathing".
- **Stale readings do not count.** A node that dies while holding a healthy
  breathing reading would otherwise satisfy the breathing check forever and
  silently disable the apnea alarm. Readings older than the node-silence window
  are ignored. This bug was real and was caught by end-to-end testing after the
  unit tests missed it; see `a_dead_node_holding_a_good_reading_cannot_suppress_apnea`.
- **Falls latch.** The firmware flag clears as soon as the person stops moving,
  so an auto-clearing fall alert could vanish before anyone looked. It stays up
  until `POST /alerts/fall/ack`.
- **Breathing plausibility matches the filter.** 6-30 BPM is exactly the
  0.1-0.5 Hz band the firmware's biquad passes. A reading outside it did not
  come through that filter as a real cycle, so it is treated as *no reading*
  rather than as a number.

### Node trust

`--alert-nodes 1` restricts alerting to node 1. Other nodes are still received
and shown in `/status` but cannot raise anything.

This exists because node health is not uniform. In the 2026-08-26 measurement,
node 3 disagreed with **itself** between the two still phases (variance 3.87 vs
1.84) and node 2 showed RSSI stdev of 6.2-6.8 dB in *all* phases including
still — a bad link, unrelated to motion. Both need placement work before their
readings should be allowed to wake anyone up at 3 a.m. Guardian ships with no
node IDs hardcoded; this is a per-site setting.

## Security posture

The vitals packets are unauthenticated, so the source address is the only
boundary available. Following the same posture as ADR-296:

- the UDP receiver binds to loopback by default;
- a routable bind (`0.0.0.0`, a LAN IP) **refuses to start** without
  `--udp-allow <IP/CIDR>`, or an explicit `--udp-insecure-lan` opt-in;
- loopback is always permitted; disallowed sources are dropped and counted, with
  rate-limited logging so a misconfigured allowlist cannot flood the log at
  ~15 Hz per node.

The HTTP surface is read-only apart from the fall acknowledgement, and binds to
loopback by default.

## Heartbeat: deferred, deliberately

Heart rate is parsed and exposed in `/status` as
`heartrate_bpm_unvalidated`. **It never drives an alert.**

Heartbeat chest displacement is ~0.2-0.5 mm against ~5-12 mm for breathing —
roughly 30x smaller — at 1-2 Hz where micro-movement dominates. Published ESP32
CSI heart-rate results generally require a motionless subject about 1 m from the
antenna in a controlled room. Across a bedroom, with an elderly person shifting
in a chair, that will not hold. More ESP32s do not fix this; it is a
sensor-physics limit, not a node-count limit. (CLAIMED — from literature, not
measured here.)

The honest path if heart rate is wanted: `edge_fused_vitals_pkt_t`
(`edge_processing.h:174`, ADR-063) already defines a 60 GHz mmWave fusion path
with `mmwave_hr_bpm` / `mmwave_br_bpm`, and a ~$12 Seeed MR60BHA2 fuses into a
packet the firmware already speaks. Guardian parses that 48-byte packet today
and surfaces the mmWave fields, so adopting the sensor is a hardware decision,
not a code one.

**This decision is still open.** It only affects the alert layer, so it does not
block anything else.

## Fall detection: still unvalidated

Guardian currently forwards the firmware's fall flag; it does not implement its
own heuristic. The heuristic is buildable (large transient, then sustained
post-event stillness, no return to upright motion). *Validating* it is the hard
part: you cannot test on your grandmother. It needs a proxy — weighted cushion
drops, or a younger person falling onto a mattress.

**Until that proxy validation exists, treat `fall` as an unverified signal.**

What Guardian now provides is the machinery to do that work, because a staged
fall is expensive and awkward to reproduce and you cannot re-stage it on every
threshold change:

```bash
guardian --record captures/fall-proxy-01.jsonl   # stage the event once
guardian-replay captures/fall-proxy-01.jsonl --inspect
guardian-replay captures/fall-proxy-01.jsonl --speed 4   # iterate forever
```

Build a library of captures — staged falls, someone sitting down heavily, a
dropped bag, normal nights — and replay the whole set against every change to
the alert rules. A capture that must *not* alert is worth as much as one that
must.

## Record and replay

`--record <path>` writes every accepted packet to a JSONL capture as
`{"offset_ms", "data"}`, flushed per packet so that killing the process — the
normal way a capture ends — keeps the seconds around the event. Packets are
recorded *after* parsing, so a capture holds only well-formed vitals and
replaying it drives the same path the live nodes do.

`guardian-replay` sends a capture back at a running Guardian:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--target` | where to send (default `127.0.0.1:5005`) |
| `--speed` | playback multiplier; `0` sends as fast as possible, which is meaningless for any rule with a timeout |
| `--repeat` | loop forever |
| `--inspect` | describe the capture and exit without sending |

Leading offsets are normalised to the first packet, so the gap between starting
the recorder and starting the nodes is not replayed as dead air.

> **Captures are personal health data.** A capture records when a specific
> person was present, moving, and breathing, and at what rate. Keep them local,
> get consent before recording anyone, and never commit them — `.gitignore`
> excludes `*.jsonl` under this crate for exactly that reason.

## Alert delivery

`--notify-command <path>` runs a command on every alert transition. Guardian
speaks no particular notification service: a three-line script wrapping `curl`
covers ntfy, Pushover, a webhook or home automation, and `mpg123 siren.mp3`
covers the case where the person who needs telling is in the next room.

`contrib/notify-ntfy.sh` is a working example. Without a notify command
Guardian only writes to the log, and says so loudly at startup, because a log
file notifies nobody.

The command receives the alert in its environment — not argv, so a detail string
can never be mistaken for a flag by whatever the operator wrote:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `GUARDIAN_ALERT_KIND` | `fall`, `no_breathing`, `no_presence`, `node_silent` |
| `GUARDIAN_TRANSITION` | `raised`, `reminder`, `cleared` |
| `GUARDIAN_SEVERITY` | `care` or `health` |
| `GUARDIAN_DETAIL` | human-readable explanation, including the evidence |
| `GUARDIAN_NODE_ID` | set only for `node_silent` |

Exit non-zero to report failed delivery.

The delivery rules are shaped by the failure that actually matters — a care
alert emitted once, at 03:00, into a notifier that happens to be down is
indistinguishable from having no monitor:

- **Care alerts retry** (`--notify-attempts`, default 3, short linear backoff).
  Node-health events do not: a flapping node would amplify rather than protect.
- **Unacknowledged care alerts repeat** every `--repeat-alert-secs` (default
  300; `0` disables) until the condition clears or is acknowledged. Node health
  never repeats.
- **Delivery never blocks reception.** The command is spawned, not awaited. A
  notifier hanging for its full timeout would otherwise stall the UDP receive
  loop for tens of seconds and manufacture the very node-silence it was being
  asked to report. There is a test for exactly this.
- **A hanging command is killed** after `--notify-timeout-secs` (default 10).
- **A broken notifier never takes the monitor down.** Failures are logged as
  `ALERT NOT DELIVERED` and the monitor keeps running.
- The command's existence is checked at startup, not at 03:00 on the night it
  matters.

## Deployment

`contrib/guardian.service` is a hardened systemd unit — `DynamicUser`,
`ProtectSystem=strict`, a syscall filter, and `RestrictAddressFamilies` limited
to what a UDP/TCP listener needs. It uses `Restart=always` rather than
`on-failure`: a monitor that dies at 03:00 and stays dead is worse than no
monitor.

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo install -m 0755 target/release/guardian /usr/local/bin/guardian
sudo install -m 0755 contrib/notify-ntfy.sh /etc/guardian/notify.sh
sudo install -m 0644 contrib/guardian.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now guardian
```

Edit the unit's `--udp-allow` to your nodes' addresses and `--alert-nodes` to
the nodes whose placement you actually trust.

## HTTP surface

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/status` | GET | full snapshot: per-node state, presence, active alerts |
| `/alerts` | GET | active alerts only |
| `/alerts/fall/ack` | POST | acknowledge a latched fall alert |
| `/healthz` | GET | liveness |

## Status: what is and is not validated

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Packet parsing | MEASURED — round-tripped against the firmware layouts in tests |
| Alert state machine | MEASURED — unit and end-to-end tests, including the failure modes above |
| Alert delivery | MEASURED — end-to-end through a real command to an HTTP endpoint |
| Behaviour against real ESP32 nodes | **NOT VALIDATED** — Guardian has not yet run against live silicon |
| Fall detection accuracy | **NOT VALIDATED** — needs proxy testing, see above |
| Heart rate | **NOT VALIDATED**, and deliberately never alerts |

Everything above the line is tested against synthetic packets built from the
firmware's own struct layouts. That is not the same as having run against the
real nodes, which remains the next step.

## Validation

```bash
cd guardian
cargo test                                  # unit + end-to-end
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

Two layers, and both earn their place:

- **Unit tests** cover the parsers, the allowlist, and the alert state machine.
  The engine takes an explicit `now: Instant` at every entry point, so timeout
  behaviour — including the 12-hour absence rule — is tested without sleeping.
- **End-to-end tests** (`tests/end_to_end.rs`) spawn the real binary, send real
  UDP packets, and read the real HTTP surface. This layer is not redundant: the
  stale-reading bug, where a dead node's last good breathing value suppressed
  the apnea alarm indefinitely, passed every unit test and was caught only here.

`evidence/` holds the measurement this design rests on: `motion-test.py` is the
A/B/C reproducer, `motion-test-results.json` its output, and
`2026-08-26-handoff.md` the original findings. `motion-test.py` measures the
*old* server's WebSocket feature stream; it is kept as the record of why
Guardian exists, and it needs that server running to execute.
